   - Prepare input tensors for BERT.

2. Fine-tune the Model:
   - Use the `transformers` library to fine-tune a BERT model on the dataset.

3. Build an Interface for the Model:
   - Create a simple interface to interact with the chatbot.

## Performance Metrics

- Include accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics from the training and validation process.

## Examples

- Provide examples of conversations with the chatbot.

## Access the Chatbot

- (Optional) Provide a link to access the chatbot online.
